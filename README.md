# 🔍 Image Recognition App

A simple and powerful Image Recognition Web App built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit.  
This app uses a pre-trained MobileNet model (trained on ImageNet) to identify objects in images with high accuracy.  

Upload any image, and the app will predict the top 3 possible objects along with their confidence scores.
